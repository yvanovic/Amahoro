There’s this woman. She loves me. If she’s not Finnish, I’ll eat my hat. At first, we even said, isn’t it hunky-dory? We’re related. ‘Are you Finno-Ugrian, too, if you don’t mind my asking?’ We try to discover national traits in each other. Unfortunately, I’m not conversant, I’m not the least bit conversant with Finnish history.
