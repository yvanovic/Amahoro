Once I told my father about this. What I mean is, asked him what northern women were like. He shrugged and made a face. ‘How should I know? Still, he asked me to his room, where I hadn’t been in a long time, and pointed to a painting which I had seen many times as child, in another apartment, in another dark, dimly lit room, a ponderous, dromedary oil painting in an ornate, self-assertive, nineteenth-century frame. It depicted Norwegian fishmongers at the market by the sea.
